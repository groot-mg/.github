## How to run
These repositories are not hosted anywhere, you might be able to run them in your local machine, it just depends if your machine is powerful enough. 

Requirements:
* Java 17
* Docker and docker-compose

To run everything together, a docker local setup is already provided on [docker-local-setup](https://github.com/groot-mg/docker-local-setup). It will build the necessary `.jar` files, create the local docker images, and start up the containers.

## Documentation
Each repository has its own documentation on Readme or Wiki pages, but a deeper explanation how everyhing work together is provided on the repo [docs](https://github.com/groot-mg/docs)
